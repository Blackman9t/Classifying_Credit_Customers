# Classifying_Credit_Customers
Classification is a type of Supervised-machine-Learning that involves the categorization of data points into discrete categories. There are two broad types of classification tasks:-
1. Binary-Classification: This involves classifying data points into two categories, for example cat or dog.
2. Multi-Class-Classification: This involves the classification of data points into more than two categories.

In this project, 
We shall explore Binary-Classification, as I create and evaluate models to classify credit-loan customers as either defaulters or Non-Defaulters.

To Follow along, kindly install and import the following libraries:-
```
import itertools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import NullFormatter
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn import preprocessing<br></font>
```
