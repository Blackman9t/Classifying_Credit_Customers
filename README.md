# Classifying_Credit_Customers
Classification is a type of Supervised-machine-Learning that involves the categorization of data points into discrete categories. There are two broad types of classification tasks:-
1. Binary-Classification: This involves classifying data points into two categories, for example cat or dog.
2. Multi-Class-Classification: This involves the classification of data points into more than two categories.

In this project, 
We shall explore Binary-Classification, as I create and evaluate models to classify credit-loan customers as either defaulters or Non-Defaulters.

To Follow along, kindly install and import the following libraries:-
```
import itertools<br>
import numpy as np<br>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
from matplotlib.ticker import NullFormatter<br>
import pandas as pd<br>
import numpy as np<br>
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker<br>
import seaborn as sns<br>
from sklearn import preprocessing<br></font>
```
