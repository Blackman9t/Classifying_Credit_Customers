# <u><h2>Classifying_Credit_Customers</h2></u>

Classification is a type of Supervised-machine-Learning that involves the categorization of data points into discrete categories. There are two broad types of classification tasks:-
1. <b>Binary-Classification:</b> This involves classifying data points into two categories, for example cat or dog.
2. <b>Multi-Class-Classification:</b> This involves the classification of data points into more than two categories.

In this project, 
We shall explore Binary-Classification, as I create and evaluate models to classify credit-loan customers as either defaulters or Non-Defaulters.
